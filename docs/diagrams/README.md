1. Go to app.diagrams.net.  If it asks you for storage, select whatever you are comfortable with.  I used Github for mine, but you certainly don't have to.  This is not where you import the CSV.
2. Select a blank diagram
3. Click "Arrange" > "Insert" > "Advanced" > "CSV".  It will be prepopulated with a sample diagram that would import and give you an example to work from.

If you need help, there's a blog post: https://drawio-app.com/import-from-csv-to-drawio/

I have also included a sample network generation here in this repo folder.  Note that the commented out stuff is actually super important; it describes your layout and presentation rules.
